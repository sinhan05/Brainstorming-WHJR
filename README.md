Brainstorming Project Progect C-90

My Application: Recipe Application
Problem: I am trying to cook something but don't have the recipe to cook with the things that I have.
Solution: An aplication that tells you what to cook based on your availible resources.
How?:
Headerscreen/Introductionscreen: Will introduce the user to the application and give them a tutorial on how to use it (How does it work?)
Ingredientsscreen: User will type into an TextInput Box all the ingredients they have availible.
Recipescreen: It will fetch recipies with Google API wanting the certain ingrediants for the cooking and will order them based on how much the recipe collaberates with the ingredients, and how liked is the recipe.
Notlikedscreen: If User does not like the recipe, then we give all the other best-liked recipies in a DropDownList made with StackNavigator.
Feedbackscreen: The User will be able to rate his experience with the app with likes and dislikes.
